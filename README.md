# EN3150 Image Processing and Machine Vision - Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains the assignment work for the EN3150 Image Processing and Machine Vision module. The assignment covers key image processing techniques such as image interpolation, segmentation, edge detection, intensity transformation, and filtering. The tasks demonstrate the application of these techniques using Python and OpenCV.

## Assignment Tasks
### Intensity Transformation:

 - Applied intensity transformations to enhance image details.
 - Focused on enhancing white and gray matter in brain MRI images by adjusting intensity levels.

### Image Interpolation:

 - Implemented and compared Nearest Neighbor and Bilinear interpolation methods.
 - Evaluated the performance of each method using the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) metric.

### GrabCut Segmentation:

 - Used the GrabCut algorithm to segment a flower image, separating the foreground from the background.
 - Enhanced the image by applying a blur to the background, followed by a visual analysis of the result.

### Sobel Filtering:

 - Applied Sobel filters to an image using three different methods:</br>
        - OpenCVâ€™s filter2D method.</br>
        - Manually implemented Sobel filters.</br>
        - Sobel filtering using the separable property.
 - Compared the results from each method and visualized the edge detection.
